Introduction:-
Incomplete or inconsistent data may be written to the rpmdb, causing corruption when a crash event occurs for an RPM or YUM transaction that was updating the RPM database.
The reason for the crash could be a variety of reasons such as killing the process prematurely, resource or disk issues. 

A crashed RPM database can cause a myriad of issues related to package-management.
Software such as EasyApache4 and YUM will also not work until the RPM database is in a functional state.

Due to this, one of cPanel & WHM's tasks during update sessions includes performing a check of the database and attempting a repair if needed.
However, sometimes you may need to run this process manually.

 
Procedure:-
There are two ways to perform this check, one via the interface and via the command-line.

 
Interface:-
  * Navigate to the following tool via the WHM and click proceed to start the process
    * WHM >> Rebuild RPM Database


Command-line:-
  * From the command line, while logged in as root, you may simply execute the following script
    * # /scripts/find_and_fix_rpm_issues
      
      * USAGE
        # scripts/find_and_fix_rpm_issues [--findonly] [--rebuildonly] [--help]

        DESCRIPTION
        Detects problems with the rpm database and will rebuild the database if it
        detects problems. Exits 0 if RPM is working properly, or if we were able
        to fix it by rebuilding its database.

        This script also detects duplicate cPanel RPMs, removes, and then
        re-installs them if necessary.

        --findonly - Detect and report problems. Do not make any changes.

        --rebuildonly - Unconditionally rebuild the RPM database.
 

If you ever experience that the script times out or does not respond, you may want to view this article which describes possible causes.
