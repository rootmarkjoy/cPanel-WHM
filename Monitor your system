Run the following commands frequently to to ensure that your system functions in the way that you expect:

Check for programs on ports that you did not install or authorize:-
# netstat -anp

Check the world_writable.txt file for all of the world-writable files and directories. This command reveals locations where an attacker can store files on your system.
# find / \( -type f -o -type d \) -perm /o+w 2>/dev/null | egrep -v '/(proc|sys)' > world_writable.txt
Note: If you fix permissions on some improperly-written PHP and CGI scripts, the script or website may no longer function.

Check the no_owner file for all files that do not have a user or group associated with them. A specific user or group should own all files, to restrict access to them.
# find / -nouser -o -nogroup >> no_owner.txt
